<p>Join <strong>Dave Wall</strong>, Citizen Science Officer at the <strong>National Biodiversity Data Centre</strong> at the back beach. We will be exploring the beach area to photograph and identify bivalve shells, seaweeds and other flotsam cast up on the shore. The remains of species cast up by the tide can be a useful indicator of what is living beneath the adjacent waves and helps us map the distribution of marine species around the Irish coast. Learn about monitoring your local shore, improving your marine species identification skills, and contributing to our knowledge of Ireland’s coastal biodiversity.</p>
<p>‘<a href="https://exploreyourshore.ie/">Explore Your Shore!</a>‘ is a NBDC initiative to build our knowledge of the distribution of marine species around the Irish coast and encourage Citizen Science surveys which will ‘help us better understand where and when marine species occur around our coast, and how they are being affected by climate change, water quality and other human impacts’.</p>
<p>More information on the NBDC’s ‘Explore Your Shore!’ project:</p>
