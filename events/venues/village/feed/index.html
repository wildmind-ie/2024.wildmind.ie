										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last decade the only concerted crate-digging I have done has been in pursuit of 7” vinyl. The search has been both intensive and extensive. There’s a golden rule that only records I can see myself playing out are allowed in the box so I’ve set the bar pretty high. Every sort of sound is catered for with the only criterion being it must have a dancing mood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I very rarely get to play a set of 45s only but I can’t think of a better place than Fenit on a Sunday afternoon for the WildMind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Location to be announced based on weather,  keep an eye on social media for updates.</p>
