<p>Ornithologist <strong>Seán Ronayne</strong> from Cobh who  is on a mission to record the sound of every bird species in Ireland will introduce the new film ‘Birdsong’ which focuses on his work, while <strong>Fionn Ferreira</strong> a young scientist and inventor from Ballydehob who is on a mission to eradicate microplastic pollution will share his &#8216;toolkit&#8217;—a blend of innovation, science, and unwavering determination—that has propelled his vision from local beaches to the global stage.</p>

<p><br />Due to its position on the fringe of the Atlantic Ocean, the west of Ireland has a humid temperate climate, which is perfect for the growth of a rich and unique range of plants, especially mosses, liverworts and ferns, many of which have more affinities to the Tropics than to Europe. These species are a highly important component of the special habitats found here, including lust temperate rainforests and cool north-facing mountain slopes. This talk will shine a light on this often overlooked, but fascinating, group of species.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In August 2020, ecologist, <strong>Dr. Rory Hodd</strong> published a paper in the Journal of British and Irish Botany detailing his discovery of a tiny fern, Stenogrammitis myosuroides in a remote area of Killarney National Park. This was the first time that this species of fern had been detected in Europe, the only other known locations that this little plant can be found are in neo-tropical cloud-forests of Jamaica and Cuba.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> This event will feature a screening of <strong>Like a Mouse</strong>, an experimental short documentary by <strong>Michael Holly &amp; Mieke Vanmechelen</strong> following Dr. Hodd&#8217;s discovery, against the backdrop of an area of natural conservation that is under threat from the pressures of an unstable, globalised ecology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A blue chip special on the wildlife and wild places of one of the world’s most iconic locations – Transylvania; a mythical land beyond the forests hiding some of Europe’s last true wilderness regions. Its soaring Carpathian Mountains and vast ancient forests still provide sanctuary for some of Europe’s most charismatic animals &#8211; wolves, bears and lynx. In Transylvania history, folklore and nature create a very special blend of wild magic.</p>

<p>We will hear from  speakers from <strong><em>RE</em>&#8211;<em>PEAT</em> </strong> a youth-led collective pushing for a peatland paradigm shift through collaboration, education, and a process of re-imagining and <strong>Peatlands and People </strong>a 7-year EC-funded LIFE Integrated Project, led by Bord na Móna:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sophie O’Callaghan</b> is a member of RE-PEAT and the Communications Officer for The Rivers Trust,</li>
<li><b><i>Arthur Devine</i></b><i> is the Technical Program Manager for the EU LIFE Integrated Project Peatlands and People.</i></li>
<li><b><i>David McNicholas</i></b><i> is an Ecologist at Bord na Móna.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session will include a screening of<strong> Bog Standard </strong>a short documentary film that focuses on community-led bog restoration projects and the custodians who have extraordinary stories to tell. The film draws on the commitment and hope of grassroot projects happening around peatland conservation in Ireland, and responds to the need for awareness of peatlands in Ireland and their central role within the climate emergency</p>

<h3><strong>Peatlands and People</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Peatlands and People</strong> is a 7-year EC-funded LIFE Integrated Project, led by Bord na Móna, the project integrates actions from five sections of the Climate Action Plan – Enterprise; Agriculture, forestry and land use; Waste and the circular economy; Public sector leading by example; and Citizen engagement, community leadership and just transition. <strong>Peatlands and People</strong> uses peatlands as a model to inspire behavioural change and build capacity and economy in Ireland’s midlands, a region of transition.</p>
