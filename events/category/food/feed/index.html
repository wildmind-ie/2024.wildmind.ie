										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wild Weeds are delighted to run a plant ID and herbal medicine workshop at the Wild Mind, this 90 minute workshop will start with a plant I.D and foraging walk along the greenway with tips on how to identify edible plants that can help support our health, followed by a demo on how to make herbal teas, infusions and a wild pesto.</p>
<p>The timing is perfect for springtime foraging when the hedgerows and fields are bursting with life.</p>

<p>Wild Weeds offers foraging, food and medicine making events in County Kerry, and began when two community herbalists got together. Noreen migrated to Kerry via Tipperary and Italy. She spent 20 years in Italy, where she became passionate about Italian cooking and foraging. Returning to Ireland in 2019 she set up home in Killarney where she works as a Health Qi Gong Instructor. Reconnecting with Irish soil, she continues her grá for health, nature and food.</p>
<p>Sarah grew up in Muckross, Killarney and from an early age was drawn to the wildlife, flora and wild coastlines of County Kerry. She has worked for 20 years in nutrition and makes products under her brand Danu Herbalist, that incorporate Irish plants, such as Gorse, Comfrey and Bladderwrack, tapping into their healing and health properties.</p>
