<p>Join <strong>Dave Wall</strong>, Citizen Science Officer at the <strong>National Biodiversity Data Centre</strong> at the back beach. We will be exploring the beach area to photograph and identify bivalve shells, seaweeds and other flotsam cast up on the shore. The remains of species cast up by the tide can be a useful indicator of what is living beneath the adjacent waves and helps us map the distribution of marine species around the Irish coast. Learn about monitoring your local shore, improving your marine species identification skills, and contributing to our knowledge of Ireland’s coastal biodiversity.</p>
<p>‘<a href="https://exploreyourshore.ie/">Explore Your Shore!</a>‘ is a NBDC initiative to build our knowledge of the distribution of marine species around the Irish coast and encourage Citizen Science surveys which will ‘help us better understand where and when marine species occur around our coast, and how they are being affected by climate change, water quality and other human impacts’.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wild Weeds are delighted to run a plant ID and herbal medicine workshop at the Wild Mind, this 90 minute workshop will start with a plant I.D and foraging walk along the greenway with tips on how to identify edible plants that can help support our health, followed by a demo on how to make herbal teas, infusions and a wild pesto.</p>
<p>The timing is perfect for springtime foraging when the hedgerows and fields are bursting with life.</p>

<p>Wild Weeds offers foraging, food and medicine making events in County Kerry, and began when two community herbalists got together. Noreen migrated to Kerry via Tipperary and Italy. She spent 20 years in Italy, where she became passionate about Italian cooking and foraging. Returning to Ireland in 2019 she set up home in Killarney where she works as a Health Qi Gong Instructor. Reconnecting with Irish soil, she continues her grá for health, nature and food.</p>
<p>Sarah grew up in Muckross, Killarney and from an early age was drawn to the wildlife, flora and wild coastlines of County Kerry. She has worked for 20 years in nutrition and makes products under her brand Danu Herbalist, that incorporate Irish plants, such as Gorse, Comfrey and Bladderwrack, tapping into their healing and health properties.</p>
